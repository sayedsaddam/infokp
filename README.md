# Inventory Management System (Basic)
This system was build just according to the client's requirements, nothing else.
The client will just save the stats for the office equipment and retrieve it, edit it and delete it if needed.
It has a database and uploaded online.
It has a login screen where the client can use his/her username and password to log in to the system to perform certain tasks.
